						(This card is incredibly long, just so we can see the
						scrolling in action. If we get to that, that is. We

						In the mean time, please enjoy this little glass effect.
						It's stupidly simple to do, but it looks pretty cool.)

					<div class="card__text-small">
						The syntax for that is simply this:

					<div class="card__text-highlight">
						backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
					</div>

					<div class="card__text-light">
						This creates this glass thing backdrop we see. We can of
						course also use some other filter, and in fact, the MDN
						has a full page on filters.
